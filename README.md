Water quality is an important issue that affects human health and the environment. To better understand the factors that impact water quality and improve prediction accuracy, researchers have turned to statistical and machine learning techniques. In this study, we examined the Acton Lake dataset and gained insights into the variables that affect water quality, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of various statistical and machine learning techniques for water quality prediction. Our approach included feature selection, data exploration, and machine learning model validation, which produced consistent and promising results. However, we also identified potential method flaws and errors and suggested the use of larger datasets, more sophisticated models, and different data types to further improve prediction accuracy. Additionally, by integrating the strengths of several models through ensemble approaches, we could enhance our research and produce more thorough and precise forecasts. Overall, our analysis lays the groundwork for future research on water quality prediction, emphasizing the potential advantages of ensemble techniques and the significance of collecting a variety of data types.
